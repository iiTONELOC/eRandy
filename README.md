# Welcome to eRandy

## COMING SOON

**eRandy**  
is the UI for a personal custom e-Reader. A specific-needs project.
eRandy is for my sister, Andrea. She has down syndrome and loves to read. Unfortunately the past few years have been rough for her as she has been slowly losing her eyesight.
Unable to enjoy her already purchased in-print books, eRandy is the solution. Book data is provided from her personal collection. Using the pyetesseract module, my python scripts(documentation to follow), and scans of each page; JSON data for each book is automatically generated. This eReader utilizes the JSON generated.
